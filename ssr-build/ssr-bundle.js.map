Highest priority will be given to a model-specific serializer, then the application serializer, then the default serializer.\n\n  Mirage ships with three named serializers:\n\n  - **JSONAPISerializer**, to simulate JSON:API compliant API servers:\n\n    ```js\n    import { createServer, JSONAPISerializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n    createServer({\n      serializers: {\n        application: JSONAPISerializer\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n  - **ActiveModelSerializer**, to mock Rails APIs that use AMS-style responses:\n\n    ```js\n    import { createServer, ActiveModelSerializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n    createServer({\n      serializers: {\n        application: ActiveModelSerializer\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n  - **RestSerializer**, a good starting point for many generic REST APIs:\n\n    ```js\n    import { createServer, RestSerializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n    createServer({\n      serializers: {\n        application: RestSerializer\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n  Additionally, Mirage has a basic Serializer class which you can customize using the hooks documented below:\n\n  ```js\n  import { createServer, Serializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n  createServer({\n    serializers: {\n      application: Serializer\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  When writing model-specific serializers, remember to extend from your application serializer so shared logic is used by your model-specific classes:\n\n  ```js\n  import { createServer, Serializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n  const ApplicationSerializer = Serializer.extend()\n\n  createServer({\n    serializers: {\n      application: ApplicationSerializer,\n      blogPost: ApplicationSerializer.extend({\n        include: ['comments']\n      })\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  @class Serializer\n  @constructor\n  @public\n*/\nclass Serializer {\n  constructor(registry, type, request = {}) {\n    this.registry = registry;\n    this.type = type;\n    this.request = request;\n\n    /**\n      Use this property on a model serializer to whitelist attributes that will be used in your JSON payload.\n\n      For example, if you had a `blog-post` model in your database that looked like\n\n      ```\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'Lorem ipsum',\n        createdAt: '2014-01-01 10:00:00',\n        updatedAt: '2014-01-03 11:42:12'\n      }\n      ```\n\n      and you just wanted `id` and `title`, you could write\n\n      ```js\n      Serializer.extend({\n        attrs: ['id', 'title']\n      });\n      ```\n\n      and the payload would look like\n\n      ```\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'Lorem ipsum'\n      }\n      ```\n\n      @property attrs\n      @public\n    */\n    this.attrs = this.attrs || undefined; // this is just here so I can add the doc comment. Better way?\n\n    /**\n      Use this property on a model serializer to specify related models you'd like to include in your JSON payload. (These can be considered default server-side includes.)\n\n      For example, if you had an `author` with many `blog-post`s and you wanted to sideload these, specify so in the `include` key:\n\n      ```js\n      createServer({\n        models: {\n          author: Model.extend({\n            blogPosts: hasMany()\n          })\n        },\n        serializers: {\n          author: Serializer.extend({\n            include: ['blogPosts']\n          });\n        }\n      })\n      ```\n\n      Now a response to a request for an author would look like this:\n\n      ```\n      GET /authors/1\n\n      {\n        author: {\n          id: 1,\n          name: 'Link',\n          blogPostIds: [1, 2]\n        },\n        blogPosts: [\n          {id: 1, authorId: 1, title: 'Lorem'},\n          {id: 2, authorId: 1, title: 'Ipsum'}\n        ]\n      }\n      ```\n\n      You can also define `include` as a function so it can be determined dynamically.\n      \n      For example, you could conditionally include a relationship based on an `include` query parameter:\n\n      ```js\n      // Include blog posts for a GET to /authors/1?include=blogPosts\n      \n      Serializer.extend({\n        include: function(request) {\n          if (request.queryParams.include === \"blogPosts\") {\n            return ['blogPosts'];\n          } else {\n            return [];\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      **Query param includes for JSONAPISerializer**\n\n      The JSONAPISerializer supports the use of `include` query parameter to return compound documents out of the box.\n\n      For example, if your app makes the following request\n\n      ```\n      GET /api/authors?include=blogPosts\n      ```\n\n      the `JSONAPISerializer` will inspect the query params of the request, see that the blogPosts relationship is present, and then proceed as if this relationship was specified directly in the include: [] array on the serializer itself.\n\n      Note that, in accordance with the spec, Mirage gives precedence to an ?include query param over a default include: [] array that you might have specified directly on the serializer. Default includes will still be in effect, however, if a request does not have an ?include query param.\n\n      Also note that default includes specified with the `include: []` array can only take a single model; they cannot take dot-separated paths to nested relationships.\n\n      If you'd like to set a default dot-separated (nested) include path for a resource, you have to do it at the route level by setting a default value for `request.queryParams`:\n\n      ```js\n      this.get('/users', function(schema, request) => {\n        request.queryParams = request.queryParams || {};\n        if (!request.queryParams.include) {\n          request.queryParams.include = 'blog-posts.comments';\n        }\n\n        // rest of route handler logic\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @property include\n      @public\n    */\n    this.include = this.include || []; // this is just here so I can add the doc comment.
