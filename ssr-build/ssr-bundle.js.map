Highest priority will be given to a model-specific serializer, then the application serializer, then the default serializer.\n\n  Mirage ships with three named serializers:\n\n  - **JSONAPISerializer**, to simulate JSON:API compliant API servers:\n\n    ```js\n    import { createServer, JSONAPISerializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n    createServer({\n      serializers: {\n        application: JSONAPISerializer\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n  - **ActiveModelSerializer**, to mock Rails APIs that use AMS-style responses:\n\n    ```js\n    import { createServer, ActiveModelSerializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n    createServer({\n      serializers: {\n        application: ActiveModelSerializer\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n  - **RestSerializer**, a good starting point for many generic REST APIs:\n\n    ```js\n    import { createServer, RestSerializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n    createServer({\n      serializers: {\n        application: RestSerializer\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n\n  Additionally, Mirage has a basic Serializer class which you can customize using the hooks documented below:\n\n  ```js\n  import { createServer, Serializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n  createServer({\n    serializers: {\n      application: Serializer\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  When writing model-specific serializers, remember to extend from your application serializer so shared logic is used by your model-specific classes:\n\n  ```js\n  import { createServer, Serializer } from 'miragejs';\n\n  const ApplicationSerializer = Serializer.extend()\n\n  createServer({\n    serializers: {\n      application: ApplicationSerializer,\n      blogPost: ApplicationSerializer.extend({\n        include: ['comments']\n      })\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n\n  @class Serializer\n  @constructor\n  @public\n*/\nclass Serializer {\n  constructor(registry, type, request = {}) {\n    this.registry = registry;\n    this.type = type;\n    this.request = request;\n\n    /**\n      Use this property on a model serializer to whitelist attributes that will be used in your JSON payload.\n\n      For example, if you had a `blog-post` model in your database that looked like\n\n      ```\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'Lorem ipsum',\n        createdAt: '2014-01-01 10:00:00',\n        updatedAt: '2014-01-03 11:42:12'\n      }\n      ```\n\n      and you just wanted `id` and `title`, you could write\n\n      ```js\n      Serializer.extend({\n        attrs: ['id', 'title']\n      });\n      ```\n\n      and the payload would look like\n\n      ```\n      {\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'Lorem ipsum'\n      }\n      ```\n\n      @property attrs\n      @public\n    */\n    this.attrs = this.attrs || undefined; // this is just here so I can add the doc comment. Better way?\n\n    /**\n      Use this property on a model serializer to specify related models you'd like to include in your JSON payload. (These can be considered default server-side includes.)\n\n      For example, if you had an `author` with many `blog-post`s and you wanted to sideload these, specify so in the `include` key:\n\n      ```js\n      createServer({\n        models: {\n          author: Model.extend({\n            blogPosts: hasMany()\n          })\n        },\n        serializers: {\n          author: Serializer.extend({\n            include: ['blogPosts']\n          });\n        }\n      })\n      ```\n\n      Now a response to a request for an author would look like this:\n\n      ```\n      GET /authors/1\n\n      {\n        author: {\n          id: 1,\n          name: 'Link',\n          blogPostIds: [1, 2]\n        },\n        blogPosts: [\n          {id: 1, authorId: 1, title: 'Lorem'},\n          {id: 2, authorId: 1, title: 'Ipsum'}\n        ]\n      }\n      ```\n\n      You can also define `include` as a function so it can be determined dynamically.\n      \n      For example, you could conditionally include a relationship based on an `include` query parameter:\n\n      ```js\n      // Include blog posts for a GET to /authors/1?include=blogPosts\n      \n      Serializer.extend({\n        include: function(request) {\n          if (request.queryParams.include === \"blogPosts\") {\n            return ['blogPosts'];\n          } else {\n            return [];\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      **Query param includes for JSONAPISerializer**\n\n      The JSONAPISerializer supports the use of `include` query parameter to return compound documents out of the box.\n\n      For example, if your app makes the following request\n\n      ```\n      GET /api/authors?include=blogPosts\n      ```\n\n      the `JSONAPISerializer` will inspect the query params of the request, see that the blogPosts relationship is present, and then proceed as if this relationship was specified directly in the include: [] array on the serializer itself.\n\n      Note that, in accordance with the spec, Mirage gives precedence to an ?include query param over a default include: [] array that you might have specified directly on the serializer. Default includes will still be in effect, however, if a request does not have an ?include query param.\n\n      Also note that default includes specified with the `include: []` array can only take a single model; they cannot take dot-separated paths to nested relationships.\n\n      If you'd like to set a default dot-separated (nested) include path for a resource, you have to do it at the route level by setting a default value for `request.queryParams`:\n\n      ```js\n      this.get('/users', function(schema, request) => {\n        request.queryParams = request.queryParams || {};\n        if (!request.queryParams.include) {\n          request.queryParams.include = 'blog-posts.comments';\n        }\n\n        // rest of route handler logic\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @property include\n      @public\n    */\n    this.include = this.include || []; // this is just here so I can add the doc comment.

You can use `passthrough` to whitelist requests, and allow them to pass through your Mirage server to the actual network layer.\n\n   Note: Put all passthrough config at the bottom of your routes, to give your route handlers precedence.\n\n   To ignore paths on your current host (as well as configured `namespace`), use a leading `/`:\n\n   ```js\n   this.passthrough('/addresses');\n   ```\n\n   You can also pass a list of paths, or call `passthrough` multiple times:\n\n   ```js\n   this.passthrough('/addresses', '/contacts');\n   this.passthrough('/something');\n   this.passthrough('/else');\n   ```\n\n   These lines will allow all HTTP verbs to pass through. If you want only certain verbs to pass through, pass an array as the last argument with the specified verbs:\n\n   ```js\n   this.passthrough('/addresses', ['post']);\n   this.passthrough('/contacts', '/photos', ['get']);\n   ```\n\n   You can pass a function to `passthrough` to do a runtime check on whether or not the request should be handled by Mirage. If the function returns `true` Mirage will not handle the request and let it pass through.\n\n   ```js\n   this.passthrough(request => {\n      return request.queryParams.skipMirage;\n    });\n   ```\n\n   If you want all requests on the current domain to pass through, simply invoke the method with no arguments:\n\n   ```js\n   this.passthrough();\n   ```\n\n   Note again that the current namespace (i.e. any `namespace` property defined above this call) will be applied.\n\n   You can also allow other-origin hosts to passthrough.

An Inflector is an object with two methods, `singularize` and `pluralize`, that Mirage will call whenever it needs to inflect a word.\n\n      Mirage has a default inflector, so if you write\n\n      ```js\n      createServer()\n      ```\n\n      you'll be using the node [inflected](https://github.com/martinandert/inflected#readme) package. This can be customized if you have irregular words or need to change the defaults. You can wead more in [the guide on customizing inflections](/docs/advanced/customizing-inflections).\n\n      You typically should be able to make your customizations using the provided inflector. It's good to match any custom inflections your backend uses, as this will keep your Mirage code more consistent and simpler.\n\n      You can also override the inflector completely and provide your own `pluralize` and `singularize` methods:\n\n      ```js\n      createServer({\n        inflector: {\n          pluralize(word) {\n            // your logic\n          },\n          singularize(word) {\n            // your logic\n          }\n        }\n      })\n      ```\n    */\n    this.inflector = config.inflector || defaultInflector;\n    this._container.register(\"inflector\", this.inflector);\n\n    /**\n      Set to `true` or `false` to explicitly specify logging behavior.\n\n      By default, server responses are logged in non-testing environments. Logging is disabled by default in testing, so as not to clutter CI test runner output.\n\n      For example, to enable logging in tests, write the following:\n\n      ```js\n      test('I can view all users', function() {\n        server.logging = true;\n        server.create('user');\n\n        visit('/users');\n        // ...\n      });\n      ```\n\n      You can also write a custom log message using the [Pretender server's `handledRequest` hook](https://github.com/pretenderjs/pretender#handled-requests).
